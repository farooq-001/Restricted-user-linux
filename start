1. Create the user & password:
sudo useradd -m ch_uk
sudo passwd ch_uk

2. Restrict the user's shell access by using a restricted shell (rbashrc)
sudo chsh -s /bin/rbash ch_uk

3. Set up a restricted environment:
sudo mkdir /home/ch_uk/bin

4. Add the allowed commands to this directory by creating symbolic links:
sudo ln -s /bin/df /home/ch_uk/bin/df
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/htop /home/ch_uk/bin/htop
#sudo ln -s /bin/ls /home/ch_uk/bin/ls

5. Update the userâ€™s PATH to only include the restricted commands: Add the following to /home/ch_uk/.bashrc:
sudo vi /home/ch_uk/.bashrc
export PATH=/home/ch_uk/bin

6. Set permissions:
sudo chown -R ch_uk:ch_uk /home/ch_uk/bin
sudo chmod 750 /home/ch_uk/bin
